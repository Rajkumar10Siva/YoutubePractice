This is text3.txt file, I am trying to add this file from local to global repository. 
Now I am checking it is updated or not in the Github.
I am updating some message directly in the Github reposiroy and I am checking it is updated automatically in local Repository or not.
If it is not updated automatically, I will pull it in the VS code terminal.
